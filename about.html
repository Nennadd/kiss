            Mr. Sol Gould Memorial Scholarship that is awarded to the top
            student that embodies the standards of clinical excellence and who

            Pierre Fauchard Academy Scholarship Award, which recognizes a top
            student with dedication and commitment to dentistry who has
            demonstrated leadership, academic and clinical excellence.
          </p>

          <h3>DR. CHESTER KLOS</h3>
          <h5>DDS</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Dr Chet Klos was born and raised on Chicago’s northwest side
            attending St Stanislaus B&M and St Genevieve grade schools, Weber
            High School, and Loyola University. As an undergraduate at Loyola,
            Chet was active in Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity, ROTC, and the
            intercollegiate rifle team. Perhaps most important, it was at Loyola
            that Chet met his future wife, Dagmar.
          </p>

          <p>
            Active duty for the Viet Nam war was deferred when Chet was accepted
            to Loyola Dental School. During his junior and senior years in
            dental school he was vice president of Delta Sigma Delta, a
            professional dental fraternity. Upon graduation in 1976, Chet and
            his wife, Dagmar, left Chicago to fulfill his military obligation.
            He was stationed at Bassett Army Hospital, Ft. Wainwright,
            Fairbanks, Alaska, followed by Madigan Army Medical Center, Ft.
            Lewis, Tacoma, Washington. During the four years at Fort Lewis,
            besides providing dental services to the hospital staff, inpatients,
            and the medically compromised at the medical center, he served as
            company commander of the 35 dental enlisted personnel for one and a
            half years, and Chief of Restorative Services for three years. Chet
            was promoted to the rank of Major while at Ft. Lewis. Following
            completion of the advanced officer course at Ft Sam Houston, Chet
            was assigned to do primarily oral surgery in a troop clinic at Ft.
            Bliss, El Paso, Texas, but found himself filling in periodically for
            the pedodontist. While there he was also a CPR instructor and
            published an article in the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial
            Surgery. Upon completion of his tour at Ft. Bliss he was awarded the
            Meritorious Service Medal, First Oak Leaf Cluster.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1985 Chet and Dagmar left the military and returned to Chicago.
            Chet joined the Dental Arts Club, the Polish dental society of
            Chicago in 1985, and served its president in 1996 and continues to
            be an Advisory Board Member. Also in 1985 Chet joined the Chicago
            Society Lodge of the Polish National Alliance, and for several years
            was chairman of the scholarship committee, and served for two years
            as recording secretary and two years as treasurer. Chet has served
            as president for five years of the Belmont-Central Unit of the
            American Cancer Society, and currently is president of the Chicago
            Graduate Chapter of Delta Sigma Delta. Also active in the Chicago
            Dental Society he has worked on the various committees including the
            Speakers committee, Registration and Credentials, and General
            Arrangements Committees for the Midwinter Meeting, Peer Review
            Committee, and was Chairman of Mediation Committee for the CDS, and
            President of the Northwest Side Branch. Currently he is Chairman of
            Mediation for the Northwest Branch of the CDS.
          </p>

          <p>
            When the dental society elected to take a more active role in the
            development of dental students, Dr. Klos agreed be a mentor and was
            assigned a freshman. In her sophomore year he and his student
            decided that the best learning experience would be for her to work
            as his dental assistant. Three years later, having graduated as one
            of the top clinical students at UIC Dental School, Dr. Larisa
            Spirtovic joined Dr. Chet Klos as an associate at his practice at
            5841 W. Belmont Avenue. In 2010 together they formed Kiss Dental PC
            and established the office at 2925 Touhy. In 2019 they sold the
            Belmont office and are now working together in the same office. Dr
            Chet with help from Dr Larisa continues to mentor students today.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chet and Dagmar live on the NW side of Chicago, enjoy their dog
            walks through the neighboring forest preserve, and bike rides on
            various trails. Dagmar is actively involved in the textile
            community, teaching dyeing, spinning, and weaving as well as having
            authored The Dyer’s Companion published by Interweave Press.
